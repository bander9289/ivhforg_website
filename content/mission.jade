p Iris Village Heritage Foundation (IVHF) was founded in 1999 to save the Bank of Chillicothe building in Chillicothe, Texas. In 2016, a renewed effort began to save the building from further decay and possible loss. It is dependent on public support, so please join by volunteering, donating, and telling us your stories of the building or surrounding area!
p The goal with this building is to save it from destruction by restoring it's usefulness. Many people see it while travelling on US Highway 287 from Fort Worth to Amarillo and even further into New Mexico and Colorado. It's likely that people would stop here if there were businesses to support, where they could also appreciate the great history of the building and town. It is a very prominent feature along the route, and the building and town are surprisingly well known. The current president of IVHF became involved only after spotting it while driving by, wanting to see something done with it, and taking action.
p There are some minor structural issues that must be addressed soon before further deterioration occurs. And there are several basic improvements required to stop deterioration so that reconditioning can begin. This will take many different skillsets, from electrical work and plumbing work to accounting and legal to running a web presence and soliciting donations. It's very likely that your skillsets are needed. And if you have more money than time, we can use that too!
